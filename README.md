# Part C: Practical Task — 3-Screen Flutter App

## Introduction
This Flutter application demonstrates navigation across **three screens** with user interaction and data transfer.  
It allows the user to enter personal details (Name, Age, and Email) in a form and then view the submitted information on a separate screen.

## How the App Works

### **Screen 1: Welcome Page**
- Displays a greeting message with the developer’s name.
- Includes a button that navigates to **Screen 2**.
- 
### **Screen 2: Input Form**
- Contains three text input fields: Name, Age, and Email.
- A Submit button is provided to proceed after filling in the details.

### **Screen 3: Display Information**
- Receives and displays the user’s submitted details neatly in a Column.
- Information such as Name, Age, and Email is shown with labels for clarity.
- The user can easily read back their input on this final screen.
